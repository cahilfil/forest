\p{a laundry list of who i am:}
\ul{
  \li{my actual name is yunus aydin. when translated literally from turkish, it would be "dolphin enlightened", so i found it fitting to pick the alias [[cahilfil]], which means the ignorant elephant.}
  \li{back in undergrad, my initial exposure to complexity theory was through [[erikdemaine]]'s [[mit-6.892-2019]], which lead to my [undergraduate thesis](/switchdoor.pdf) under the supervision of [[standazivny]].}
  \li{once upon a time, i made a puzzle game called [r v r s e](https://github.com/cahilfil/rvrse).}
  \li{i'm into running, weightlifting, bouldering, film photography, and competitive programming.}
  \li{i'm \strong{not good} at \em{any} of the activities above. some stats:

    \li{my highest codeforces rating was [2003](https://codeforces.com/profile/determinism). i recently [got back into it](https://codeforces.com/profile/nlpoly) and planning to beat that [by the end of \<html:s>{2025} 2026](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/newyear?p0=137).}
