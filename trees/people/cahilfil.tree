\p{a laundry list of who i am:}
\ul{
  \li{my actual name is yunus aydin. when translated literally from turkish, it would be "dolphin enlightened", so i found it fitting to pick the alias [[cahilfil]], which means the ignorant elephant.}
  \li{back in undergrad, my initial exposure to complexity theory was through [[erikdemaine]]'s [[mit-6.892-2019]], which lead to my [undergraduate thesis](/switchdoor.pdf) under the supervision of [[standazivny]].}
  \li{once upon a time, i made a puzzle game called [r v r s e](https://github.com/cahilfil/rvrse).}
