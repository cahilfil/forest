\p{today was a light day. after last year's unsuccessful attempt, i tried to revamp [[home]] for ~3 hours. [new forester release](https://www.forester-notes.org/011P/index.xml) definitely didn't help.}

\p{i am still a \strong{believer} (in the cause of doing research in public). i don't enjoy the dance of excuses, but one of the reasons it didn't work last year was that it introduced too much friction on top of the actual work i was doing. now that my coursework load has decreased and that i am more familiar with both my research and [[forester]], and most importantly now that i have a working github action to deploy this website, i feel it's worth giving a second shot. if it doesn't work this year either, i'm quite sure it would due to my incompetence, so don't get discouraged to create your own [[playground]]s.}
