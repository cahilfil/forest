\p{today was a light day, since i woke up with a mysterious headache. my initial goal was to finish the meta-complexity tutorial of the [[dimacs-frontiers-2024]]. i failed doing so. i was only able to do the following:}
\ul{
  \li{3 hours of lectures: [[ucr-cs215-2025]] and [[ucr-cs219-2025]]}
  \li{1 hour of updating [[home]]}
  \li{30 mins of e-mails etc.}
  \li{30 mins of cardio, more specifically elliptical (average hr: 144bpm)}
}
