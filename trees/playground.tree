\p{this website is a [forest](https://www.forester-notes.org/tfmt-000V.xml) made by [[forester]]. it's close to what [niklas luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) called a [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview), or [andy matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) called [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX). although there are differences between these objects/methods, i'm currently not too hung up on all the nuances, basically since "who has time for that?" but also because "premature optimization is the roof of all evil" [as knuth put it](https://doi.org/10.1145/356635.356640).}

\p{my motivation to create these notes is essentially to become more active in the process of learning. in my experience, especially with mathematics, you kind of need to reinvent the wheel to be able to ride it.}

\p{the decision to make it public is definitely more controversial, since the lack of privacy might influence what or how i write, which might potentially be less productive. however, this very tension is actually what made me decide to make it public. most of my life, my self-worth was intimately linked to being intelligent, thus the worst sin has been to be perceived as stupid, which is also quite counter-productive. i believe learning to overcome this fear will make me a better researcher (and hopefully more at peace with who i am).}

\p{and i picked the word [[playground]] to refer to these notes because i'm essentially intending to [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_through_play): to engage actively (and hopefully pleasurably) in the open-ended platonic word of complexity-theoretic constructs.}
